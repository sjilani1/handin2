        <h1> A/B Testing </h1>


        <div class="overview">
            <h2> Overview </h2>
            <p> The goal of this project was to test the difference between page A and page B to see which is most successful in obtaining success in the task of scheduling an appointment
              The main aim of the project is to understand how even minor changes in design have the ability to impact user interactions and 
            how A/B testing is one the best ways to understand how those interactins may differ </p>


          <h2> The Change</h2>
          <p>  
            I altered page B by changing the appointment button to a darker color. My aim was to instantly direct the eye to setting appointments and 
            in doing so minimising the time the user spends searching for an appointment button. 
          </p>

          <h2> Comptutations and Hypthesis  </h2>
           

           <h3>Misclick Hypothesis </h3> 
<ul>  
  <li> 
Null Hypothesis: The misclick rate of page A is the same as the misclick rate of page B </li>
<li>Alternate Hypothesis: The rate of misclicks in page A is greater than the rate of misclicks in page B </li>
<li> Justification for Alterate: The color change in B will make the eye drift there immediately and reduce the misclicks to the button </li>

</ul>


<h3> Time Hypothesis </h3>

<ul>  
  <li> 
Null Hypothesis: The time take on page A is the same as the time taken on page B </li>
<li>Alternate Hypothesis: The time on page A is greater than the time taken on page B 
</li>
<li> Justification for Alterate: The color change in B will make the eye drift there immediately and reduce the time to make an appointment</li>

</ul>

<h3>  Number of Clicks Hypothesis   </h3>
<p> I chose number of clicks to see if the efficiency of clicks changes with a change in page  </p>

<ul>  
  <li> 
Null Hypothesis: The number of clicks on page A is the same as the number of clicks on page B </li>
<li>Alternate Hypothesis: The number of clicks on page A is greater than the number of clicks on page B  </li>
<li> Justification for Alterate: The color change in B will make the eye drift there immediately and reduce the number of clicks to make an appointment</li>

</ul>

<ul> 

<Li>      Misclick rate:			Chi-squared test      </Li>
<Li>     Time on page:			one tailed T test     </Li>
<Li>         Number of clicks:		one tailed T test   </Li>
 </ul>

            <p>  I chose chi square because this was a categorical test and the variable I am looking it is a categorical variable. 


              A 0.05 p-value, the assumption that there is a 95% confidence that there is a difference between the data. However, the p-value obtained is around 0.123 which is significantly higher than 0.05. Given this it becomes clear that there is not a significant difference or enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 
              This test fails to reject the null hypothesis. 
                </p>

            <p>  I chose a one-tailed test as my variables were numerical and the test is to decide whether there is a significant difference between B and A where B takes less time. 

              Based on the p value, a 0.05 p value indicates a significant difference between the two pages. The p value i obtained was 0.0464 B is less than A, indicating that the mean of B is significantly less than the mean of A. 
              
              Therefore we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.

          <p>I chose a one-tailed test as my variables were numerical and the test is to decide whether there is a significant difference between B and A where B takes less num_click

            Based on the p value, a 0.05 p value indicates a significant difference between the two pages. The p value i obtained was 0.106 which indicates that there is no significant difference. 
            
            Therefore, we dont have significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

          <h2>  Summary Statistics  </h2>

          <p> Based on the average and variance of A and B what I understood is while the mean may seem to indicate a slight 
          lean towards on page it is important to take the variance into account because a higher variance means that the overlap is greater and the p-value becomes more 
          difficult to decipher. My understanding when A/B testing is that simply looking at mean/mode are not viable methods
          to know if one out performs the other and it is important to check multiple features to see if a difference was made. In thsi scenario, 
          I do not believe that my change was likely more successful than A as it did not reject the null hypothesis.  </p>
